# GoLang Backend Microservice

Educational Platform backend service created according to Go Clean Template

## Overview
The purpose of this service is to handle all requests to the platform

As an example was added 3 handlers that show all project features:
- Get Course (`v1/course/getcourse`) -- retrieve info about course from Postgres using ID
- Get User (`v1/user/getuser`) -- retrieve info about user from Postgres using ID
- Get Report (`v1/report/get-top-courses-report`) -- retrieve all needed data from Redis/Postgres

## Project structure
Using the principles of Uncle Bob :)  
You can find detailed project structure description in go clean template repo
